      <h2>Y-Axis Eligibility Evaluation</h2>
      <p>
        When you plan to migrate abroad to work, invest, or settle, you must
        first determine whether you can apply for a visa to enter that nation.
        This can help you evaluate whether applying for a visa to migrate to a
        given nation is worth your time and effort. This is where determining
        eligibility is crucial.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each country has its own set of eligibility criteria. Countries such as
        Australia, Canada, Saskatchewan, Quebec, the United Kingdom, and
        Germany use a points-based system to determine whether applicants are
        eligible to live, work, or study in their country.
      </p>
      <p>
        You must score the appropriate points to meet the eligibility
        requirements for these countries. The number of points available and
        the conditions for earning them vary by country.
      </p>
      <p className="highlighted">
        Eligibility evaluation is a process that determines whether or not you
        might be able to apply for a specific visa for a particular country.
        Regarding migrating overseas, countries such as Canada, Australia, and
        the United Kingdom require a points-based eligibility evaluation.
      </p>
      <p>
        You should obtain an eligibility evaluation before filling out the
        application form for these nations. This will assist you in determining
        whether you satisfy the requirements and can secure the required
        points. As a result, youâ€™ll be able to analyze your odds of acquiring
        the visa.
      </p>
